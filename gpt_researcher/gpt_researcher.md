## Introduction

GPT Researcher is an autonomous agent designed for comprehensive web and local research on any given task. It produces detailed, factual, and unbiased research reports with citations.  GPT Researcher offers a full suite of customization options to create tailor-made and domain-specific research agents. Inspired by the "Plan-and-Solve" and RAG papers, it addresses misinformation, speed, determinism, and reliability by offering stable performance and increased speed through parallelized agent work.

## Why GPT Researcher?

Traditional manual research is time-consuming and resource-intensive.  Existing LLMs face several challenges:

*   **Outdated Information:** LLMs trained on outdated data can hallucinate, making them unreliable for current research.
*   **Token Limitations:**  Current LLMs have token limits that are insufficient for generating long, detailed research reports.
*   **Limited Web Sources:**  Many existing services use limited web sources, leading to shallow results and potential misinformation.
*   **Bias:** Selective web sources can introduce bias into research tasks.
* **Time Consuming:** Objective conclusions for manual research can take weeks.

## Architecture

The core architecture of GPT Researcher utilizes "planner" and "execution" agents.

1.  **Planner Agent:** Generates research questions related to the main research query.
2.  **Execution Agents:**  Gather relevant information for each research question generated by the planner.
3.  **Publisher:** Aggregates all findings from the execution agents into a comprehensive final report.

**Steps:**

1.  Create a task-specific agent based on a research query.
2.  Generate questions that collectively form an objective opinion on the task.
3.  Use a crawler agent for gathering information for each question.
4.  Summarize and source-track each resource.
5.  Filter and aggregate summaries into a final research report.

## How GPT Researcher was Built

### Moving from Infinite Loops to Deterministic Results

Inspired by the "Plan and Solve" paper, GPT Researcher adopts a deterministic approach:

*   **Planning:**  First, an outline of research questions is created, dividing the main task into smaller subtasks.
*   **Execution:**  Agents are executed deterministically for each outline item (research question).

This approach eliminates infinite loops and ensures task completion within a finite timeframe.

### Aiming for Objective and Unbiased Results

To address factuality and bias:

*   **Law of Large Numbers:**  Gathering information from a large number of sources reduces bias.
*   **LLM Summarization:**  Leveraging LLMs to summarize factual information from multiple sources improves factuality.

The system scrapes a sufficient number of relevant websites to form an objective opinion.

### Speeding up the Research Process

GPT Researcher utilizes parallel processing using Python's `asyncio` library to significantly speed up the research process.  Agent tasks are executed concurrently.

```python
# Example of parallel scraping
tasks = [async_browse(url, query, self.websocket) for url in await new_search_urls]
responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

This parallelization reduces the average research time to approximately three minutes, an 85% improvement compared to synchronous approaches like AutoGPT.

### Finalizing the Research Report

The final report is generated by providing all aggregated information to a powerful LLM (GPT-4 by default) with a specific prompt:

> "{research_summary}" Using the above information, answer the following question or topic: "{question}" in a detailed report ‚Äî The report should focus on the answer to the question, should be well structured, informative, in depth, with facts and numbers if available, a minimum of 1,200 words and with markdown syntax and apa format. Write all source urls at the end of the report in apa format. You should write your report only based on the given information and nothing else.

### The Final Architecture

1.  **Generate Outline:** Create research questions to form an objective opinion on the task.
2.  **Crawler Agents:** For each question, trigger a crawler agent to scrape relevant online resources.
3.  **Filter and Summarize:** Track, filter, and summarize each scraped resource, keeping only relevant information.
4.  **Aggregate and Generate Report:** Aggregate all summarized sources and generate the final research report.

### Going Forward

The future of online research automation involves AI agents capable of understanding and analyzing various forms of online content (videos, images, graphs, etc.) and handling vast amounts of information.  GPT Researcher aims to be a versatile research agent, easily integrable into existing agent workflows.

1.  **Install Selenium:** `pip install selenium`
2.  **Download WebDriver:**
    *   Chrome: [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)
    *   Firefox: [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
    *   Safari: Built-in, no download required.
3.  Ensure WebDriver is in your system's `PATH`.

### Choosing the Right Method

*   **BeautifulSoup (Static):** Simple, static websites; speed is a priority.
*   **Selenium (Dynamic):**  JavaScript-heavy websites; requires simulating user interactions.
*   **Tavily Extract:** Production use, reliable and consistent results.

### Troubleshooting

*   **Selenium Fails:** Ensure correct WebDriver is installed and in your `PATH`.
*   `ImportError` (Selenium):  Make sure you've installed the `selenium` package.
*   **Missing Content:** Try switching between static and dynamic scraping.

Choose the scraping method that best suits your research needs and target websites.
